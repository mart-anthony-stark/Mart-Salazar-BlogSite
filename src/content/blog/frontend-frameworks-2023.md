  One of the standout features of Next.js is its support for server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG). With SSR, Next.js pre-renders the React components on the server, enabling fast initial page loads and improved SEO. SSG allows developers to generate static HTML files at build time, resulting in static sites that can be deployed on a content delivery network (CDN) for even faster performance.
- **Automatic Code Splitting and Routing**: Next.js includes built-in support for automatic code splitting, which breaks down the application into smaller chunks and loads only the necessary code for each page. This optimizes performance by reducing the initial load time and allows for faster subsequent navigations. Additionally, Next.js provides a powerful routing system that simplifies the creation of dynamic and nested routes within the application.

- **Incremental Static Regeneration and Real-Time Updates**:
  Next.js introduces incremental static regeneration (ISR), which allows for the generation of dynamic pages at runtime. This feature enables developers to specify how often a page should be re-rendered, making it suitable for content that requires frequent updates. Additionally, Next.js provides real-time updates through WebSockets or server-sent events, enabling live data streaming and real-time user interactions.
